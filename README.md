# Presentations-Soft-Skills-Project
A project where I present data to Executive and sales departments regarding the performance of their company.
Description of My Project
In this project, I developed a comprehensive data analysis presentation for "AdventureWorks," a company I'm well-acquainted with from previous sprints. The task involved creating a dashboard or spreadsheet, followed by two tailored presentations for different departments within the company.

Key Aspects of My Work:
Data Extraction and Dashboard Creation:

Utilized SQL queries to extract relevant data, ensuring the queries were well-documented and structured.
Designed a dashboard/spreadsheet that could be slightly modified to cater to the unique needs of two different departments. Emphasis was placed on clarity, relevance, and insightfulness.
Presentation Preparation:

Developed two versions of a presentation: a concise 2-minute version and a detailed 10-minute version. Each was tailored to suit the data literacy levels and interests of the target departments.
Incorporated techniques learned in the sprint to clearly communicate data insights, with a focus on storytelling and engagement.
Slide Design and Content:

Ensured that slides were well-structured, with clear labels and naming conventions.
Used charts, tables, and animations effectively to make the data easily understandable and visually appealing.
Presentation Skills:

Paid attention to body language and voice modulation to enhance the delivery of the content.
Employed techniques to hold the audience's attention, such as asking questions and integrating elements of storytelling.
Analysis and Recommendations:

Addressed potential drawbacks in the analysis and offered recommendations for further analysis.
Thoughtfully considered next steps and actionable insights that could benefit the respective departments.
Project Outcomes:
This project highlights my ability to not only analyze and interpret complex data sets but also to communicate these findings effectively to varied audiences. It showcases my skills in SQL, data visualization, and presentation, tailored to the specific needs and understandings of different departments within a company.
